# Project Overview

In this Book tracking mini app,  users select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasized using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library persists information as the application is interacted with.

# To Get Started

* **1** clone the repository
* **2** npm install
* **3** npm run dev (equivalent to npm run start) 

## Features

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
